## Difference between Kubernetes and Docker

* ****Kubernetes**** and ****Docker**** are both popular tools in the world of containerization, but they serve different purposes and are often used together to manage containerized applications effectively.

## [Docker](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/wiki/What-is-Docker%3F#what-is-docker)

* ****Definition:**** Docker is a platform and set of tools for creating, deploying, and managing containers. It allows developers to package an application and all its dependencies into a single, portable container that can run consistently across different environments.

* ****Primary Function:**** Containerization. Docker makes it easy to build, ship, and run containers.

* ****Use Case:**** Ideal for developers to create isolated environments for applications, simplifying development, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Kubernetes

* ****Definition:**** Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration platform designed to automate containerized applications' deployment, scaling, and management across a cluster of machines.

* ****Primary Function:**** Orchestration. Kubernetes manages the lifecycle of containers, including load balancing, scaling, and self-healing (restarting failed containers).

* ****Use Case:**** Ideal for running large, complex applications composed of many microservices, and managing containerized applications in production environments.

## Key Differences

* ****Scope:**** Docker focuses on building and running containers, while Kubernetes manages containers at scale, automating their deployment, scaling, and operations.

* ****Orchestration:**** Docker provides basic orchestration through Docker Swarm, but Kubernetes offers advanced orchestration capabilities, such as automated rollouts and rollbacks, load balancing, and self-healing.

* ****Scalability:**** Kubernetes excels in scaling applications automatically based on traffic and resource usage, which is more complex to set up with Docker alone.

* ****Networking and Load Balancing:**** Kubernetes has a robust networking model with built-in load balancing features, while Docker requires additional configuration for these tasks.

## How They Work Together

* ****Complementary Roles:**** Docker is used to create and run containers, while Kubernetes manages and orchestrates these containers across multiple hosts, making them work together seamlessly in a production environment.
