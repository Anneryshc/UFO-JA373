### Containerization
- **Definition**: A lightweight method of running isolated applications in the same operating system using containers.

- **How it Works**: Containers package the application and its dependencies together but share the host systemâ€™s OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.

- **Advantages**: Faster startup, less resource usage, and easier to move between different environments (like development, testing, and production).

- **Use Case**: Ideal for microservices, cloud-native apps, and when you need quick and consistent deployment.

### Virtualization
- **Definition**: A technology that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server, each with its own OS.

- **How it Works**: Virtualization uses a hypervisor to create and manage VMs, each running a complete, isolated operating system with dedicated resources.

- **Advantages**: Greater isolation, can run different OS types (Windows, Linux) on the same hardware.

- **Use Case**: Best for running multiple operating systems on one machine, legacy applications, and situations requiring strong isolation between workloads.

### Key Differences

*  **Resource Efficiency:** Containers are more efficient and faster since they share the host OS, whereas VMs require more resources due to having their own OS.

* **Isolation:** VMs provide stronger isolation with separate OS instances, while containers offer lighter isolation but are quicker to start and consume fewer resources.

* **Performance:** Containers generally perform better than VMs because they use fewer resources and start up faster.
